# MCP Memory Server Migration Plan

## From: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` (JSONL, Node/npx)
## To: `mcp-memory-service` (SQLite-vec, Python/uvx)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (reference instance: `intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-service` branch `feature/standalone-orchestration-service-migration`)  
**Date:** 2026-03-29  
**Author:** Copilot — research, plan, and implementation  
**Post-Implementation Update:** Revised with findings from first implementation run to serve as the reference guide for applying this migration to the template repo and future cloned instances.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The current `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` has a **confirmed race condition** ([#2579](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/2579)) — concurrent processes writing to the same `memory.jsonl` file without locking or atomic writes corrupts the file, producing JSON parse errors like `"expecting value: line 1 column N"`.

**Impact:** Every opencode orchestration run spawns multiple agents (orchestrator + up to 6 concurrent subagents), each sharing the same memory MCP server process. Concurrent `saveGraph()` calls hit the unprotected `writeFile()` path, and the file gets corrupted mid-run.

**Fix status upstream:** The atomic write commit (`03ddb97`) was pushed to a feature branch but **never merged to `main`**. The real multi-instance fix (file locking, [PR #3286](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/pull/3286)) is **still open**. The npm package `v2026.1.26` (latest) still uses plain `writeFile` with zero protection.

---

## 2. Setup Type Analysis

Based on the [mcp-memory-service wiki](https://github.com/doobidoo/mcp-memory-service/wiki), there are 4 setup types:

| Setup Type | Backend | Install Method | Concurrency Safety | Fits Our Use Case? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PyPI + stdio** | SQLite-vec (default) | `pip install mcp-memory-service` / `uvx` | **YES** — SQLite WAL mode + `busy_timeout=15000` pragma, zero DB locks | **YES — recommended** |
| **PyPI + HTTP server** | SQLite-vec | `uv run memory server --http` | **YES** — same SQLite + HTTP coordinator | Overkill for MCP stdio |
| **Docker** | SQLite-vec | `docker-compose up` | **YES** | Redundant — already in devcontainer |
| **Cloudflare/Hybrid** | Cloudflare D1 + SQLite | env vars + API tokens | **YES** | Too complex, adds cloud dep |

### Recommendation: **PyPI + stdio (SQLite-vec backend)**

**Rationale:**
- SQLite-vec with WAL mode handles concurrent access correctly — this directly resolves the race condition
- `busy_timeout=15000` auto-configured in v8.9.0+ means concurrent writes queue rather than corrupt
- stdio transport is what opencode natively uses for MCP servers
- `uvx mcp-memory-service` works identically to `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` — zero-install ephemeral run via `uv` (already in the devcontainer)
- No HTTP server, OAuth, or external services needed
- The `.db` file is a SQLite database — can be cached in CI just like the current `.jsonl` file

---

## 3. API Surface Migration (Breaking Change)

This is the core complexity. The two servers expose **completely different MCP tools**.

### Tool Name Mapping

| Old Server Tool | New Server Tool | Semantic Equivalent? |
|---|---|---|
| `create_entities` | `store_memory` | **Partial** — old creates graph nodes; new stores text+tags |
| `create_relations` | *(no direct equivalent)* | New server has knowledge graph with typed edges, but API is different |
| `add_observations` | `store_memory` | Store additional facts → store a new memory |
| `delete_entities` | `delete_memory` | Delete by entity name → delete by content hash |
| `delete_observations` | `delete_memory` | Same |
| `delete_relations` | *(delete handled implicitly)* | Edge cleanup is automatic in v10.29.1 |
| `read_graph` | `retrieve_memory` / `search_by_tag` | Read all → retrieve by query or tag |
| `search_nodes` | `retrieve_memory` | Semantic search equivalent |
| `open_nodes` | `retrieve_memory` | Open specific → retrieve specific |

### Key MCP Tools Exposed by `mcp-memory-service`

From the integration guide and feature list:
- **`store_memory`** — store content with optional tags and memory_type
- **`retrieve_memory`** — semantic search for memories
- **`search_by_tag`** — tag-based retrieval
- **`delete_memory`** — remove by content hash
- **`check_database_health`** — health/diagnostics

### What Changes in Agent Instructions

The agent files currently instruct agents to:
1. **At task start:** `Call read_graph or search_nodes to load prior project context from memory`
2. **During work:** `Persist important findings via create_entities / add_observations`
3. **At completion:** `Store outcomes and lessons learned in the knowledge graph`

These will become:
1. **At task start:** `Call retrieve_memory or search_by_tag to load prior project context from memory`
2. **During work:** `Persist important findings via store_memory with relevant tags`
3. **At completion:** `Store outcomes and lessons learned via store_memory`

---

## 4. Scope of Changes

> **Implementation note:** The original plan underestimated scope. The actual migration touched **40 files** across 7 categories (not the ~24 originally estimated). Key discoveries are noted with ⚠️ below.

### 4.1 Configuration Files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `opencode.json` → `mcp.memory` | Replace `["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]` command with `["uvx", "mcp-memory-service"]`; replace `environment` from `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` to `MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND`, `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH`, and `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PRAGMAS` |
| `opencode.json` → `permission.mcp_tool` | Replace all 9 `memory:*` tool permissions with 5 new ones: `memory:store_memory`, `memory:retrieve_memory`, `memory:search_by_tag`, `memory:delete_memory`, `memory:check_database_health` |
| `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | Replace single `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` env var with 3 new vars: `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH=${containerWorkspaceFolder}/.memory/memory.db`, `MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND=sqlite_vec`, `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PRAGMAS=busy_timeout=15000,journal_mode=WAL,synchronous=NORMAL` |
| ⚠️ `.factory/mcp.json` | Replace npx command+args with `uvx` + `mcp-memory-service` (Factory Droid MCP config) |
| ⚠️ `.qwen/settings.json` | Replace npx command+args with `uvx` + `mcp-memory-service` (Qwen Code MCP config) |
| ⚠️ `.opencode/package.json` | **Remove** the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` npm dependency (no longer needed; keep `server-sequential-thinking`) |
| ⚠️ `docker-compose.yml` | Add `MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND`, `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH=/opt/orchestration/.memory/memory.db`, and `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PRAGMAS` env vars to the `orchestration-server` service |

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: opencode.json schema restriction

The opencode.json schema does **NOT** support a separate `"args"` field on MCP server definitions. The `mcp-memory-service` PyPI README shows `uvx mcp-memory-service` as the full invocation (no subcommand needed for stdio mode). Use:

```json
"memory": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["uvx", "mcp-memory-service"],
  "environment": {
    "MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND": "sqlite_vec",
    "MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH": "${MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH}",
    "MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PRAGMAS": "busy_timeout=15000,journal_mode=WAL,synchronous=NORMAL"
  }
}
```

Do **NOT** add `"args": ["server"]` — this causes a schema validation error (`Property args is not allowed`). The command array alone is sufficient.

#### ⚠️ Database filename convention

Use `memory.db` (not `sqlite_vec.db`) as the database filename. This is simpler, consistent with the `.memory/` directory purpose, and avoids confusion. All paths should reference `.memory/memory.db`.

### 4.2 Workflow & Script Files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/orchestrator-agent.yml` | Update "Seed memory file" step: change `memory.jsonl` check to `memory.db`; replace `wc -l`/`wc -c` with `stat -c%s` (binary file, line count is meaningless) |
| `scripts/devcontainer-opencode.sh` | Update status command diagnostic: change `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` env var to `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH`; change default path from `memory.jsonl` to `memory.db`; replace `wc -l`/`wc -c` with `stat -c%s` for size reporting |
| ⚠️ `.github/workflows/prompts/orchestrator-agent-prompt.md` | **Critical** — this is the runtime prompt injected into every orchestration run. Contains `read_graph`, `add_observations`, `create_entities`, `search_nodes` references at 3 distinct locations (Step 1 startup, Step 3 guidance, and Final/completion section). All must be updated. |

### 4.3 Agent Instruction Files — `.opencode/agents/` (18 files)

All 18 files in `.opencode/agents/`:

```
agent-instructions-expert.md  backend-developer.md  cloud-infra-expert.md
code-reviewer.md  database-admin.md  debugger.md  developer.md
devops-engineer.md  documentation-expert.md  frontend-developer.md
github-expert.md  odbplusplus-expert.md  orchestrator.md  planner.md
product-manager.md  qa-test-engineer.md  researcher.md  ux-ui-designer.md
```

**Verified search-and-replace patterns (exact strings used in implementation):**

For all 17 non-orchestrator agents, each file has exactly 2 occurrences:
1. `Call \`read_graph\` or \`search_nodes\` to load prior project context from memory` → `Call \`retrieve_memory\` or \`search_by_tag\` to load prior project context from memory`
2. `Persist important findings via \`create_entities\` / \`add_observations\`` → `Persist important findings via \`store_memory\``

#### ⚠️ `orchestrator.md` has 5 ADDITIONAL occurrences beyond the standard 2

| Location | Old Pattern | New Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Operating Procedure step 1 (MANDATORY STARTUP) | `Call \`read_graph\` or \`search_nodes\` to load prior project context` | `Call \`retrieve_memory\` or \`search_by_tag\` ...` |
| Operating Procedure step 12 (MANDATORY COMPLETION) | `Call \`create_entities\` / \`add_observations\` to persist task outcomes...to the knowledge graph` | `Call \`store_memory\` to persist task outcomes...to persistent memory` |
| Mandatory Tool Protocol section title + lines | `### Knowledge Graph Memory` + `read_graph or search_nodes` + `create_entities, add_observations, or create_relations` | `### Persistent Memory` + `retrieve_memory or search_by_tag` + `store_memory` |
| Protocol Compliance Checklist | `☐ \`read_graph\` / \`search_nodes\` was called` | `☐ \`retrieve_memory\` / \`search_by_tag\` was called` |
| Protocol Compliance Checklist | `☐ Important findings were persisted to the knowledge graph` | `☐ Important findings were persisted to persistent memory` |

### ⚠️ 4.3b Agent Instruction Files — `.factory/droids/` (18 files)

**This was NOT in the original plan.** The `.factory/droids/` directory mirrors `.opencode/agents/` for the Factory Droid CLI. The same 18 files exist with the same 2-pattern replacement, and `orchestrator.md` has the same 5 extra occurrences. **Do not skip this directory.**

```
agent-instructions-expert.md  backend-developer.md  cloud-infra-expert.md
code-reviewer.md  database-admin.md  debugger.md  developer.md
devops-engineer.md  documentation-expert.md  frontend-developer.md
github-expert.md  odbplusplus-expert.md  orchestrator.md  planner.md
product-manager.md  qa-test-engineer.md  researcher.md  ux-ui-designer.md
```

### 4.4 AGENTS.md (root-level instructions)

| Section | Change |
|---|---|
| `<protocol id="knowledge_graph_memory">` | Rename to `<protocol id="persistent_memory">`; update `<title>` from "Knowledge Graph Memory" to "Persistent Memory"; replace 9-tool `<tools>` block with 5 new tools; update `<required_usage_points>` text |
| `<agent_checklist>` | `Called read_graph / search_nodes` → `Called retrieve_memory / search_by_tag`; `Persisted important findings to knowledge graph memory` → `Persisted important findings to persistent memory` |
| `<agent_specific_guardrails>` (orchestrator rule) | `read_graph before every new task` → `retrieve_memory before every new task` |
| `<instruction id="memory_default_usage">` in `<tool_use_instructions>` | Update `<title>`, `<tools>` element (all 9 → 5 new), and `<guidance>` text to reference new tool names and protocol ID |
| `<tech_stack>` | `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` → `mcp-memory-service (SQLite-vec persistent memory via uvx)` |

### 4.5 Local Instruction Modules

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `local_ai_instruction_modules/ai-development-instructions.md` | Lines referencing Memory Tool — update tool name list in parentheses and all 3 sub-bullets (task START, significant work, task END) |

---

## 5. Testing & CI Plan

### 5.1 Pre-Commit Validation (MANDATORY)

Run the full validation suite before every commit:

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File ./scripts/validate.ps1 -All
```

**Expected results from implementation run:**
- actionlint: PASS
- PSScriptAnalyzer: PASS
- JSON syntax: PASS (validates `opencode.json`, `.factory/mcp.json`, `.qwen/settings.json`, `.opencode/package.json`)
- gitleaks: PASS
- prompt-assembly tests: PASS (36/36)
- image-tag-logic tests: PASS
- watchdog-io-detection tests: PASS (23/23)

> **Note:** Pester tests may show `SecurityError` on Windows due to execution policy — this is a pre-existing issue, not related to the migration. CI runs on Linux where this doesn't apply.

### 5.2 Post-Implementation Grep Verification

After all edits, verify zero old tool name references remain in active files:

```bash
# Should return ONLY matches in docs/ and plan_docs/ (historical documentation)
grep -rn 'read_graph\|search_nodes\|create_entities\|add_observations\|create_relations\|delete_entities\|delete_observations\|delete_relations\|open_nodes' \
  --include='*.md' --include='*.json' --include='*.yml' --include='*.sh' \
  . | grep -v '/docs/' | grep -v '/plan_docs/' | grep -v '/.archived/'
```

This should return **zero results**. If any active file matches, fix it before committing.

Also verify no stale env vars or file paths:

```bash
grep -rn 'MEMORY_FILE_PATH\|memory\.jsonl' \
  --include='*.json' --include='*.yml' --include='*.sh' --include='*.ps1' \
  . | grep -v '/docs/' | grep -v '/plan_docs/'
```

### 5.3 New Test: Memory Server Smoke Test (optional)

Add a test that validates the memory server starts and responds to MCP protocol:

```bash
# test/test-memory-server.sh
# 1. Start mcp-memory-service via uvx in stdio mode
# 2. Send a store_memory request via stdin JSON-RPC
# 3. Verify success response
# 4. Send a retrieve_memory request
# 5. Verify the stored memory is returned
# 6. Verify the .db file exists and is valid SQLite
```

> **Note:** This test requires `uv`/`uvx` to be installed and network access for first-run package download. Consider gating behind a `HAS_UVX` check.

### 5.4 New Pester Test: Memory Server Config Validation (recommended)

```powershell
# test/Validate-MemoryServer.Tests.ps1
Describe 'Memory Server Configuration' {
    It 'opencode.json uses uvx mcp-memory-service' {
        $config = Get-Content opencode.json | ConvertFrom-Json
        $config.mcp.memory.command | Should -Be @('uvx', 'mcp-memory-service')
    }
    It 'opencode.json has correct permission entries' {
        $config = Get-Content opencode.json | ConvertFrom-Json
        $perms = $config.permission.mcp_tool
        $perms.'memory:store_memory' | Should -Be 'allow'
        $perms.'memory:retrieve_memory' | Should -Be 'allow'
        $perms.'memory:search_by_tag' | Should -Be 'allow'
        $perms.'memory:delete_memory' | Should -Be 'allow'
        $perms.'memory:check_database_health' | Should -Be 'allow'
    }
    It 'No agent file references old memory tool names' {
        $oldTools = 'read_graph|search_nodes|create_entities|add_observations|create_relations|delete_entities|delete_observations|delete_relations|open_nodes'
        $hits = Get-ChildItem .opencode/agents/*.md, .factory/droids/*.md |
            Select-String -Pattern $oldTools
        $hits | Should -BeNullOrEmpty
    }
    It 'devcontainer.json has MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH' {
        $dc = Get-Content .devcontainer/devcontainer.json | ConvertFrom-Json
        $dc.remoteEnv.MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty
    }
}
```

### 5.5 Existing Test Updates

| Test | Change Needed |
|---|---|
| `test/validate-agents.ps1` | Add assertion: no agent file contains old tool names (see Pester test above) |
| CI workflow (`validate.yml`) | No changes needed — existing `-Test` switch picks up new Pester tests |

---

## 6. Local Usage (Windows / VS Code Insiders / Copilot)

### 6.1 OpenCode (local, non-devcontainer)

Same `opencode.json` config works locally. Requirements:
- `uv` installed locally (you already have it)
- First run of `uvx mcp-memory-service` downloads the package and ONNX model (~200MB one-time)
- Set `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH` env var to a local path (e.g., `$HOME/.mcp-memory/memory.db`)

### 6.2 VS Code Insiders (Copilot Chat MCP)

VS Code Insiders supports MCP servers in `settings.json`:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json or user settings
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "memory": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["mcp-memory-service"],
        "env": {
          "MCP_MEMORY_STORAGE_BACKEND": "sqlite_vec",
          "MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/.memory/memory.db"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.3 Shared DB Path (Optional)

For a shared experience across opencode + VS Code on the same machine, point both at the same `.db` file. SQLite WAL mode handles concurrent readers/writers safely.

---

## 7. Devcontainer / CI Changes

### Devcontainer Image

The devcontainer already has `uv` installed. `uvx mcp-memory-service` will download on first use. **No Dockerfile changes needed** (the Dockerfile lives in the external `intel-agency/workflow-orchestration-prebuild` repo).

However: first run downloads ONNX model (~200MB). For CI stability, consider:
- **Option A:** Accept cold-start cost (one-time per workflow run, cached by uv)
- **Option B:** Pre-install in the prebuild image (requires external repo change)

**Recommendation:** Option A for now. The uv cache will handle subsequent runs within the same devcontainer session.

### CI Cache Update

```yaml
# .github/workflows/orchestrator-agent.yml
# Cache path stays as .memory/ — the directory is the same, only the file inside changes
- name: Restore knowledge graph memory cache
  uses: actions/cache/restore@SHA # v4
  with:
    path: .memory/
    key: orchestrator-memory-${{ github.repository }}

- name: Seed memory file into devcontainer workspace
  run: |
    mkdir -p .memory
    if [ -f .memory/memory.db ]; then
      echo "Restored memory database: $(stat -c%s .memory/memory.db) bytes"
    else
      echo "No cached memory database found — starting fresh"
    fi
```

> **Note:** The cache `path: .memory/` and `key:` pattern remain unchanged — only the seed step diagnostic changes from `memory.jsonl`/`wc` to `memory.db`/`stat`. The cache save step (`actions/cache/save`) needs no changes since it saves the whole `.memory/` directory.

---

## 8. Rollback Plan

If the migration causes issues:
1. Revert `opencode.json` `mcp.memory` block to the old npx command
2. Revert agent files (git revert the commit)
3. Delete `.memory/memory.db`
4. Old `memory.jsonl` can be restored from CI cache

The migration is fully reversible in a single git revert.

---

## 9. Implementation Order (verified)

> The order below was verified during the first implementation. Phases are sequenced to minimize context-switching and maximize bulk-edit efficiency.

| Phase | Description | File Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | `opencode.json` — MCP server block + permission block | 1 | ⚠️ Do NOT add `"args"` field — put everything in `"command"` array |
| **Phase 2** | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` — env vars | 1 | Replace 1 env var with 3 |
| **Phase 3** | `AGENTS.md` — mandatory tool protocols, checklist, guardrails, tech_stack, tool_use_instructions | 1 | 6 distinct edit locations |
| **Phase 4** | `local_ai_instruction_modules/ai-development-instructions.md` | 1 | 1 edit location (Memory Tool bullet) |
| **Phase 5** | `.opencode/agents/*.md` — 17 non-orchestrator agents (2 replacements each) + orchestrator.md (7 replacements) | 18 | Use bulk find-and-replace; orchestrator.md needs separate, targeted edits |
| **Phase 6** | `.factory/droids/*.md` — same as Phase 5 but for Factory Droid agents | 18 | Mirror of Phase 5; identical patterns |
| **Phase 7** | `.github/workflows/orchestrator-agent.yml` — cache seed step | 1 | `memory.jsonl` → `memory.db`; `wc` → `stat` |
| **Phase 8** | `scripts/devcontainer-opencode.sh` — status diagnostic | 1 | `MEMORY_FILE_PATH` → `MCP_MEMORY_SQLITE_PATH`; `memory.jsonl` → `memory.db` |
| **Phase 9** | `.github/workflows/prompts/orchestrator-agent-prompt.md` — runtime prompt | 1 | 3 edit locations (startup, guidance, completion) |
| **Phase 10** | Ancillary configs: `.factory/mcp.json`, `.qwen/settings.json`, `.opencode/package.json`, `docker-compose.yml` | 4 | Easy bulk edits |
| **Phase 11** | Run `validate.ps1 -All` | - | Must pass before commit |
| **Phase 12** | Run grep verification (Section 5.2) | - | Zero active-file matches required |
| **Phase 13** | Add tests (Pester config validation, optional smoke test) | 1-2 new files | |

**Total files modified:** ~40 (18 + 18 agent files + ~7 config/workflow/script files)

---

## 10. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ONNX model download fails in CI | Low | High (run fails) | uv caches aggressively; retry logic in workflow |
| Agent behavior changes | Medium | Medium | Tool names are only referenced in instruction text, not in code; agents adapt |
| `mcp-memory-service` MCP protocol incompatibility with opencode | Low | High | Test locally before pushing; opencode supports standard MCP stdio |
| CI cache miss on first run (no `.db` file) | Expected | Low | Same as current behavior with empty `.jsonl` |
| `uvx` not available in devcontainer | Very Low | High | `uv` is pre-installed in prebuild image; `uvx` is a `uv` subcommand |

---

## 11. Approval Checklist

- [x] Approved: Switch from `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` to `mcp-memory-service`
- [x] Approved: SQLite-vec backend via stdio (no HTTP server)
- [x] Approved: Full tool-name migration across all agent files + AGENTS.md
- [x] Approved: CI cache path change (`.memory/memory.jsonl` → `.memory/memory.db`)
- [ ] Pending: New tests added (Pester config validation + optional smoke test)
- [x] Approved: Local VS Code Insiders config recommendation

**Implementation completed in reference instance.** This plan is now the reference for porting to the template repo.

---

## 12. Lessons Learned (Post-Implementation)

1. **Scope was significantly underestimated.** The original plan identified ~24 files. Actual count was **40 files** due to `.factory/droids/` mirror and ancillary configs (`.factory/mcp.json`, `.qwen/settings.json`, `.opencode/package.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, orchestrator-agent-prompt.md).

2. **Always grep the entire repo** before starting edits. The initial file list was built from known locations; the comprehensive grep revealed 4 additional config files and the entire `.factory/droids/` directory.

3. **`orchestrator.md` is special.** Both `.opencode/agents/orchestrator.md` and `.factory/droids/orchestrator.md` have ~7 edit locations each (vs. 2 for other agents). Treat as a separate edit pass.

4. **opencode.json schema is strict.** No `"args"` field allowed on MCP server definitions. The original `mcp-memory-service` README suggests `server` as a subcommand, but for opencode stdio mode, `["uvx", "mcp-memory-service"]` alone is the correct invocation.

5. **Use `memory.db` not `sqlite_vec.db`.** The original plan used `sqlite_vec.db` but `memory.db` is simpler and more maintainable. Be consistent across all files.

6. **Binary file diagnostics.** Replace `wc -l` / `wc -c` (line + byte count, meaningful for JSONL) with `stat -c%s` (byte size only, appropriate for SQLite binary).

7. **Documentation files are exempt.** The migration plan doc itself, archived docs, and plan_docs will still contain old tool names as historical references. This is correct — only active config, agent instructions, and runtime code need updating.

8. **Bulk-edit efficiency.** The 17 non-orchestrator agents in each directory (`.opencode/agents/` and `.factory/droids/`) have identical replacement patterns. Use multi-file find-and-replace tooling (34 replacements per directory can be batched into a single operation).
